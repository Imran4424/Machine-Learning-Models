# Machine-Learning-Models

#### According to wikipedia

**Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.**


So, Machine Learning is a subset of artificial Intelligence where computers learns from data and improve their perfromance on a task without being explicitly programmed.

Data is really important for machine learning because machine learning relies on data to train models and learn patterns.

#### Formal Definition

Arthur Samuels Describes **Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**

#### Machine Learnin Examples

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- Google Search Engine
- Facebook photo recognization
- Self Driving Cars

#### Types of Machine Learning

There are basically three main types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Additionally, there is a more specific category called **semi-supervised** learning, which combines elements of both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.

## Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are technical buzzword now.

But, people often confused about two. They think they are all the same but they are not. There is some difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.

As Arthur Samuels Describes **Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**

As I said, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. So let's say it old school way, Every machine learning project or theories are artificial intelligence but every artificial intelligence theories or projects are not machine learning.

Then let's see now, what's not machine learning to better understand the difference.

- Machine learning is not based on logic or rule it is based on statistics
- Machine learning has not understanding of the world
- Machine learning is not study of neuro science
